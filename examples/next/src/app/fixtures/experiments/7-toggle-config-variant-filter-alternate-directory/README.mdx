# Using Varied Code without Toggling its Directory

This example demonstrates the use of a `__toggleConfig.json` within a folder,
preventing a variation folder from being connected to a join point, yet showing
that this variation folder can still be accessed from elsewhere in the codebase.

The use-case is for a feature that spans many parts of a codebase, yet with a desire
that only certain join points act as an entry point to the feature.  The variant
folder structure is used to provide a logical grouping for the feature holistically,
but is not being used to create join points wherever they appear.  It might also be
that a dependent module is imported by multiple consumers, and a variation is needed in
only _some_ consumers when the variation is active.

This example demonstrates a page that renders a component and a string value that is
imported both by the page and the component.

If an `experiments` header is set, with a `"test-feature": { "bucket": "test-variant" }`
decision, the varied component will show, including the varied dependent string value
(since it is accessing this directly from the sibling variation folder).  The version of
the string value imported directly by the page will still show the control string value,
since it is accessing that from the base file location, which is not varied since a
`__toggleConfig.json` within that location has an empty `joinPoints` array.
