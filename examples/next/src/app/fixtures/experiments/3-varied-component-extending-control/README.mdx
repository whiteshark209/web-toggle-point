# Extending / Composing a Module in Variation

This example shows a component module being varied, and that variant
composing the original module into its implementation.

The webpack plugin ensures that circular references are avoided.

If an `experiments` header is set, with a `"test-feature": { "bucket": "test-variant" }`
decision, the "Control 1" component is composed into a "Variant 1", augmenting
the control.
