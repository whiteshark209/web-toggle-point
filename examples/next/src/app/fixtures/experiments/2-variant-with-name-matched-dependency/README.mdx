# Varying a Module And It's Dependency

This example shows a component module being varied along with a local dependency.

Although Join Points will, by default, be added for both the module and its dependency,
despite the component being the only enacted point cut (imported from the wider codebase),
the join point on the dependency will be harmlessly defused (not used) at runtime.

If an `experiments` header is set, with a `"test-feature": { "bucket": "test-variant" }`
decision, the "Control 1" component is replaced by a "Variant 1". The
control and the variant both use their local copy of the dependency.
