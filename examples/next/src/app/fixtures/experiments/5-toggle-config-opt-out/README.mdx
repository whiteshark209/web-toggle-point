# Opting Out of Join Points using a local Toggle Config

This example demonstrates the use of a `__toggleConfig.json` within a folder, 
restricting all potential join points to the contents of its `joinPoints` array.

If an `experiments` header is set, with a `"test-feature": { "bucket": "test-variant" }` decision,
the control component will still show, since the `__toggleConfig.json` has an empty `joinPoints` array.
