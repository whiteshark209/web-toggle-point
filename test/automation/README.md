## Automation Tests

This project separates out the playwright install from the monorepo.

These are designed to run in an automation pipeline, but you can run them locally.

> [!NOTE]
> The `event` example in `serve` does visual snapshot testing; successful results will be reliant on a matching Operating System & Chromium versions.
